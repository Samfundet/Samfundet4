# API docs

API docs are generated by [drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html).

API documentation is available at:

[Redoc](http://localhost:8000/schema/redoc/)

or

[Swagger-UI](http://localhost:8000/schema/swagger-ui/#/)

🐋 _When backend server is running_

## Make sure the docs are up to date

To make sure the docs are up to date you can updated the API documentation schema by running:

```bash
# 📁 Navigate to the Samfundet4 directory
sudo docker compose exec backend bash
```

then, inside of the docker container:

```bash
# 🐋 Inside the container, run:
poetry-run-spect
```

💡 Note: You might encounter some error messages during this process. These errors are typically related to drf-spectacular not being able to parse certain views in views.py. However, the tool will still attempt to generate the documentation, though the results might not be fully comprehensive.

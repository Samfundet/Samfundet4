# API docs

API docs are generated by [drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html).

API documentation is available as two different interfaces:

[Swagger-UI](http://localhost:8000/schema/swagger-ui/#/) or [Redoc](http://localhost:8000/schema/redoc/)



🐋 _When backend server is running_

## API schema file

If you want a schema file for the API you can go to [http://localhost:8000/schema/](http://localhost:8000/schema/).

A schema file will be downloaded which can be used for multiple purposes, like sharing API documentation, or to generate code for recreating or testing the API.

> 💡 Note: You might encounter some error messages during this process. These errors are typically related to drf-spectacular not being able to parse certain views in views.py. However, the tool will still attempt to generate the documentation, though the results might not be fully comprehensive.

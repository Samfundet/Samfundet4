## Introduction

The Windows Subsystem of Linux (WSL) lets you run programs which traditionally only run in Linux.

## Install WSL

To run the project in WSL, you obviousy first need WSL.
Follow [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) by Microsoft. The main step is running the
following in an administrator PowerShell or command prompt:

```shell
wsl --install
```

This should install WSL with the Ubuntu distribution.

## Next steps

Since you now have a working Linux environment, the remaining steps of setting up the project are identical with the
Linux guide, so click the link below to continue the process.

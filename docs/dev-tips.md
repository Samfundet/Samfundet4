# Development Tips

## Forms

For all your form needs: [SamfForm documentation](/docs/technical/forms.md)

## Billig

The payment system for Samfundet events. Billig uses an
external database running in cirkus, and is therefore a bit different
from the rest of the system. [Billig documentation](/docs/technical/billig.md)

## Seeding the database

Seed scripts are used to populate the database with dummy data for testing. 
[Seed documentation](/docs/technical/seed.md).

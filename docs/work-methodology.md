# Work methodology

1. Create an issue describing the task.
    - If you can solve the task quickly, don't spend time creating an issue, just solve it!
    - Assign the issue to someone
    - Add relevant labels
2. Create a branch for the task.
    - Desired branch name is in the format `<your name>/<title>`
    - You may include the issue number in the branch title if you wish
    - Example: `bob/125-fix-button-bug`
    - Branch names should always be lowercase
3. Write code, commit, push.
    - Remember to write good commit messages, even if they'll be squashed when merging, it helps reviewers :~)
4. Create a Pull Request (PR)
5. Request review from others.
   - Tip: Post a link to the PR and tag specific people you want to review it in the #review channel on Slack
   - You should also review your own PRs with a critical eye
     - Is my PR too big? Should I split it up into multiple smaller PRs?
     - Does the PR include many unnecessary changes, such as blank line changes?
6. Never resolve threads started by others. Instead, write:
    - "Done"
    - Reasons for disagreement
    - Reasons for not fixing it (typical case: out of scope for this PR)
    - Describe how you solved the issue in an alternative way
7. Owners of any threads hit `Resolve` once they are satisfied.
8. Update and/or resolve any conflicts with the master branch.
9. Owner of the PR merges it.

# Work methodology

1. Always create issue first, preferably in English.
2. Assign developer on issue.
3. Create branch from issue (choose source).
   - Desired branch name is on the format `<issuenumber>-<issuetitle>`.
   - Example: `1-init-project`.
4. Assign developer on branch.
5. Write code, commit, push.
6. Create PR (Pull Request) to intended source branch.
7. Request review.
8. Never resolve threads startet by others. Write e.g.:
   - `Done`
   - Reasons for disagreement.
   - Reasons for not fixing it.
   - Describe how you solved the issue in an alternative way.
9. Owner of thread hits `Resolve` when they are satisfied.
10. Update and/or fix conflicts branch with source.
11. Owner of the PR merges it.

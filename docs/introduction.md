# Introduction to Samfundet4

Welcome to Samfundet4! This guide will introduce you to the technologies used in the project, and guide you through
installing the project on your machine.

## Technologies

Samfundet4 is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/). Django is a Python
framework, which we use as our backend. React is a library for building frontend applications, and we use it with
the [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.
